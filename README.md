# Uniformed ⚛️

I got really fed up with the way you do forms in React. I also don't like the sheer autocracy that other solutions tend to impose over the way you do forms.

So, I created **uniformed** as an attempted solution to all of these problems.

Its fundamental principle is being very, very...

<sub>small</sub>

It currently clocks in at 1.08kB gzipped, which is probably less than a tenth of the competition.

I'd argue that forms are so different, that it's really a bad idea to assume anything other than the most essential function of changing values in objects.

I do have plans to make Uniformed highly extensible, so that it becomes really easy to include stuff like pristine checking and error validation as simple "middlewares" or sorts. Do check back sometime soon.
